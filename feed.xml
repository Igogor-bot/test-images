    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Discover how to use n8n's Chat Trigger node to power advanced chatbot workflows, control access, manage sessions, and customize user experience for your AI chat interfaces.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Chat Trigger node in n8n is a versatile, powerful tool for building AI-driven chatbot workflows and integrating chat interfaces with automation. Whether you want a public-facing chatbot, an internal assistant, or embedded conversational AI, the Chat Trigger is the cornerstone of such automated conversations. Let’s explore how it works, its configuration options, and practical best practices for leveraging its full capabilities.</p>

<h2>What Is the Chat Trigger Node?</h2>
<p>The Chat Trigger node is designed for workflows where chat is the primary user interface. Each message sent to the chat executes your workflow, so there's a direct, real-time connection between chat activity and workflow logic. You can choose between n8n’s hosted chat interface or building your own embedded chat, apply varied authentication options, load previous sessions, and define precisely how responses are managed.</p>

<h2>Workflow Execution and Usage Considerations</h2>
<p>Every message sent via the Chat Trigger initiates an execution of your workflow. This means one conversation, regardless of how long or involved, uses one execution per user message. For example, a 10-message chat session consumes 10 executions. This is vital to keep in mind when selecting payment plans or estimating usage.</p>

<h2>Configuring the Chat Trigger Node</h2>
<p>The node can be tailored for different deployment scenarios and user experiences. Below are the major configuration parameters:</p>

<h3>1. Public vs. Manual Availability</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Make Chat Publicly Available</strong>: Toggle to allow anyone (public) or restrict to manual interface during development.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Mode: Access Mechanism</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Hosted Chat</strong>: Use n8n&#39;s out-of-the-box chat interface, easily configured and managed.</li>
  <li><strong>Embedded Chat</strong>: For a custom look or platform integration, build your own chat widget/interface that connects to n8n using the provided webhook URL.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Authentication Methods</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>None</strong>: Open to anyone.</li>
  <li><strong>Basic Auth</strong>: Requires username/password (same credentials for all users).</li>
  <li><strong>n8n User Auth</strong>: Only n8n-registered users can chat.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Initial Messages (Hosted Chat Only)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Set the welcoming or introductory message shown upon chat page arrival.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hosted Chat Options</h2>
<p>When using the Hosted Chat mode, further options fine-tune the user experience and security:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Allowed Origin (CORS)</strong>: Specify a comma-separated list of permitted origins for accessing the chat URL, or <code>*</code> to allow all.</li>
  <li><strong>Input Placeholder, Title, Subtitle</strong>: Set the text for interface elements to customize branding or instructions.</li>
  <li><strong>Load Previous Session</strong>: Let users pick up conversations where they left off by restoring chat history. Requires a memory sub-node (see next section for details).</li>
  <li><strong>Response Mode</strong>: Dictate how responses are delivered to users (more below).</li>
  <li><strong>Require Button Click to Start Chat</strong>: Optionally display a 'New Conversation' button.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Embedded Chat Options</h2>
<p>For those using a custom chat client (such as a website widget or mobile app), available options include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Allowed Origin (CORS)</strong>: As above, control permitted sources.</li>
  <li><strong>Load Previous Session</strong>: Enable session continuity using memory sub-nodes.</li>
  <li><strong>Response Mode</strong>: As described in the next section.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Managing Chat Memory and Session Continuity</h2>
<p>To provide a seamless user experience and memory across sessions, connect both the Chat Trigger and the handling Agent node to a memory sub-node, such as <em>Memory Manager</em>, <em>Redis Chat Memory</em>, etc. This creates a single source of conversational truth, allowing messages and state to persist and be retrieved as needed.</p>
<p>Loading previous sessions greatly enhances usability, especially for complex customer support or repetitive assistant interactions.</p>

<h2>Defining Response Flows: Modes Explained</h2>
<p>The Chat Trigger node supports two primary response modes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>When Last Node Finishes</strong>: The output from the last executed node in your workflow is immediately sent as the chat response. This is suitable for straightforward chatbots, Q&amp;A bots, or when responses don’t need additional formatting or handling.</li>
  <li><strong>Using Response Nodes</strong>: Manually determine what’s sent to the user—ideal when additional logic, formatting, or branches are required. Use <em>Respond to Chat</em> or <em>Respond to Webhook</em> nodes to customize the output. Only these nodes' data will be rendered as responses, not the raw output from the last workflow node.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach lets you build multi-step decision trees, insert delays, summarize or restructure answers, and more, before crafting the final message for the user.</p>

<h2>Manual Responses and Output Parameters</h2>
<p>By default, any connected Agent or Chain node should produce an <code>output</code> or <code>text</code> parameter—the Chat Trigger sends the value of this key to the chat user. If you need advanced responses (e.g., formatting, filtering, external API calls), use a <code>Respond to Chat</code> node and set the Trigger’s response mode to <strong>Using Response Nodes</strong>.</p>
<p>If you use a different parameter name, the entire returned object is sent, not just the specific value, potentially confusing your users or bloating the chat UI.</p>

<h2>Streaming Responses in Real-Time</h2>
<p>The Chat Trigger supports streaming, enabling real-time updates to the user during long-running or data-rich workflows. For example, AI agents generating responses iteratively can stream their intermediate and final outputs, giving users a more interactive and responsive experience. Enable streaming in the workflow and use nodes with streaming support.</p>

<h2>Common Use Cases and Best Practices</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Public Chatbots</strong>: Toggle ‘Make Publicly Available’ for customer-facing bots, but ensure proper authentication if sensitive data is discussed.</li>
  <li><strong>Internal Assistants</strong>: Restrict to n8n User Auth or Basic Auth, ensuring that only authorized team members have access.</li>
  <li><strong>Custom-Branded Experiences</strong>: Leverage the interface customization fields in Hosted Chat.</li>
  <li><strong>Complex Logic & Integrations</strong>: Use ‘Using Response Nodes’ for transformation, enrichment, and conditional responses.</li>
  <li><strong>Persistent User Journeys</strong>: Always connect a memory sub-node if you enable session persistence.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Troubleshooting and Common Issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Incorrect Response Content</strong>: If users see objects or unexpected data, review that your Agent or Respond node outputs a <code>text</code> or <code>output</code> parameter only.</li>
  <li><strong>Session Not Loading</strong>: Double-check memory node linkage and ensure both Chat Trigger and Agent/Chain nodes are connected to the same memory sub-node.</li>
  <li><strong>Authentication Problems</strong>: Make sure the correct credentials are set and that users are entering the correct username/password with Basic Auth, or are logged in with n8n User Auth.</li>
  <li><strong>Excess Workflow Executions</strong>: Monitor chat volume to avoid unexpected usage charges.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Templates and Advanced Examples</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>RAG Starter Template</strong>: Integrate retrieval-augmented generation with vector stores, forms, and custom logic for smarter bots.</li>
  <li><strong>Unify Multiple Triggers</strong>: Design a workflow that handles both form triggers and chat in a seamless pipeline.</li>
  <li><strong>Outbound Voice Calls from Chat or Jotform</strong>: Combine chat and voice workflows for rich omnichannel engagement.</li>
</ul>
