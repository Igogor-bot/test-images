    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The n8n Chat Trigger node lets you create customizable chatbot and chat interface workflows, supporting authentication, session memory, response streaming, and both hosted or embedded deployment modes.</p>
<h2>Introduction to the Chat Trigger Node</h2><p>The n8n Chat Trigger node is designed for building advanced AI chatbots and conversational interfaces within your automated workflows. By integrating this node, you can set up chat-based automations for a wide variety of use cases, from customer support bots to conversational AI agents. The Chat Trigger node is highly flexible, supporting both n8n-hosted chat and embedded chat deployments, various authentication methods, memory features, and streaming responses.</p><h2>Understanding How the Chat Trigger Node Works</h2><p>Every inbound message to a workflow configured with a Chat Trigger node will initiate a workflow execution. If a user sends ten messages during a conversation, that counts as ten executions—important to monitor in high-traffic or cost-sensitive environments. Review your n8n plan and execution allowance before going live to ensure your workflow scales appropriately.</p><h2>Deployment Modes: Hosted and Embedded Chat</h2><ul><li><strong>Hosted Chat:</strong> Leveraging n8n’s built-in conversational interface, this mode is best for most users who need minimal setup and want to use n8n’s configurable UI elements for chat.</li><li><strong>Embedded Chat:</strong> For more advanced scenarios, you can build or customize your own chat interface. Your frontend will need to interact with the webhook URL provided in the node's configuration, allowing greater UX flexibility.</li></ul><h2>Authentication Options</h2><p>The Chat Trigger node provides three ways to control who can access your chat interface:</p><ul><li><strong>None:</strong> Anyone can use the chat, no restrictions applied.</li><li><strong>Basic Auth:</strong> Restricts access to users with valid credentials—useful for private dashboards or beta testing. You’ll need to set up or select a Basic Auth credential with a username and password. All users share these credentials.</li><li><strong>n8n User Auth:</strong> Only n8n platform users can access the chat—ideal for internal tools where you want to limit usage to authenticated team members.</li></ul><h2>Initial Chat Messages (Hosted Chat Only)</h2><p>Optionally display a warm greeting or informative prompt by configuring one or more initial messages. These messages are shown to users immediately on page load in the hosted chat interface, helping provide context or instructions.</p><h2>Node Options and Customization</h2><h3>Allowed Origin (CORS)</h3><p>For both Hosted and Embedded chat, you can restrict which domains are allowed to make requests to your chat endpoint. Specify a comma-separated list of permitted origins (URLs). The default <code>*</code> allows all origins, but for greater security, specify domains matching your deployment or UI hosting environments.</p><h3>UI Text Settings (Hosted Chat Only)</h3><ul><li><strong>Input Placeholder:</strong> Text shown in the user’s input field before they start typing.</li><li><strong>Title and Subtitle:</strong> Useful for branding or succinct chat descriptions.</li></ul><h3>Session Memory and Loading Previous Sessions</h3><p>To create a more natural, context-aware chat, you can enable loading messages from previous chat sessions. When enabled (not 'Off'), connect both your Chat Trigger and Agent nodes to the same memory sub-node (e.g., Simple Memory, MongoDB Chat Memory). This shared memory ensures user context persists across user messages and sessions, allowing coherent multi-turn conversations.</p><h3>Response Modes</h3><p>Decide how chat responses are generated and delivered:</p><ul><li><strong>When Last Node Finishes:</strong> The output from the last node in your workflow (often an Agent or Chain node) is used as the response. This is straightforward for simple reply scenarios.</li><li><strong>Using Response Nodes:</strong> More advanced—use specialized nodes like <strong>Respond to Chat</strong> or <strong>Respond to Webhook</strong> within the workflow. This lets you manipulate messages, chain multiple actions, and choose precisely what is returned to the user.</li><li><strong>Streaming Response:</strong> If your workflow supports it (for example, with LLM or AI Agent nodes), enable streaming responses for real-time updates in the chat UI as processing occurs. This can dramatically enhance user experience for long-running or generative tasks.</li></ul><h3>Require Button Click to Start Chat (Hosted Chat Only)</h3><p>Optionally, display a "New Conversation" button to the user rather than starting the chat automatically, giving users more explicit control over session initiation.</p><h2>Session Memory: Best Practices</h2><p>When enabling session memory, it’s crucial that both your Chat Trigger node and your AI/Agent node connect to the same memory sub-node. This ensures a single source of truth for session context and is required for features like “load previous session.” Incorrect memory configuration may result in context loss or unexpected conversation continuity breaks.</p><h2>Manual Response Handling and Custom Logic</h2><p>In some cases, you may wish to alter or enrich an Agent’s reply before it’s sent to the user—such as formatting, translation, or filtering out unwanted content. You can accomplish this by setting a parameter named <code>text</code> or <code>output</code> from your own intermediary nodes. If you use a different parameter name, the complete object will be sent, which may be undesirable.</p><p>When you use a <strong>Respond to Chat</strong> node, remember to switch the Chat Trigger's response mode to "Using Response Nodes" for end-to-end custom control.</p><h2>Workflow Execution Considerations</h2><p>Every chat message triggers a new workflow execution, so consider the performance and cost implications, especially if your use case involves rapid back-and-forth chatting or high concurrency. Use memory-efficient nodes, handle errors gracefully, and set appropriate limitations for public-facing bots to prevent abuse.</p><h2>Templates and Real-World Examples</h2><p>The n8n community provides a variety of templates you can use as a starting point for popular use cases, including:</p><ul><li>RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbots integrating with vector stores and OpenAI</li><li>Unified triggers for complex multi-channel workflows</li><li>Triggering AI-powered voice calls from form submissions</li></ul><p>Review these templates and adapt them to your requirements to accelerate your chatbot or conversational AI deployment.</p><h2>Security: Authentication and CORS Practices</h2><p>Whenever deploying a chat interface in a production environment, especially one exposed to the public internet, use robust authentication and CORS policies. Limit the <strong>Allowed Origin</strong> to necessary domains and avoid using <code>*</code> in production. If gathering or processing sensitive data, always require authentication via n8n User Auth or Basic Auth at a minimum.</p><h2>Troubleshooting and Common Issues</h2><ul><li>Incorrect session memory linkage results in loss of conversational context.</li><li>If chat responses aren’t returned as expected, verify your parameter names (<code>text</code> or <code>output</code>).</li><li>For streaming to work, ensure downstream nodes (e.g., AI agent) support streaming and that it’s enabled in both node and workflow.</li></ul><p>For further help, visit n8n’s <a href="https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/?utm_source=n8n_app&utm_medium=node_settings_modal-credential_link&utm_campaign=%40n8n%2Fn8n-nodes-langchain.chatTrigger">official documentation</a> or community discussion forums.</p><h2>Key Takeaways</h2><ul><li>The Chat Trigger node is the cornerstone for AI-powered chat workflows in n8n, offering both hosted and embedded chat modes.</li><li>Authentication and CORS settings provide necessary security and access controls for public or private chatbots.</li><li>Memory and session handling enable advanced multi-turn conversations and persistent chat history.</li><li>Flexible response modes allow for simple bot replies or fully programmable, streaming, and actionable responses using dedicated nodes.</li><li>Workflow executions scale with chat usage—plan accordingly for performance and budget.</li></ul><h2>References</h2><ul><li><a href="https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/?utm_source=n8n_app&utm_medium=node_settings_modal-credential_link&utm_campaign=%40n8n%2Fn8n-nodes-langchain.chatTrigger">Official source</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>
